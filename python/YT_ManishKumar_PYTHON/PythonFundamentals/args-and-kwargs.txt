By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments.
However, sometimes you may not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function.
*args and **kwargs allow functions to accept a unknown number of arguments.

# Arbitrary Arguments - *args
If you do not know how many arguments will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name.
This way, the function will receive a tuple of arguments and can access the items accordingly:


# Using *args with Regular Arguments
You can combine regular parameters with *args.
Regular parameters must come before *args:

# Arbitrary Keyword Arguments - **kwargs
