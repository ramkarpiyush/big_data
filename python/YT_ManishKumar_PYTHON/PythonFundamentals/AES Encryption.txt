# AES Encryption:
AES = Advanced Encryption Standard

- AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing data.

# Key Features of AES:
- Symmetric Key: Same key is used for encryption and decryption.
- Block Cipher: Operates on fixed-size blocks of data (128 bits).
- Key Sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits.
- Rounds:
    AES-128 → 10 rounds
    AES-192 → 12 rounds
    AES-256 → 14 rounds
- Security: Resistant to all known practical attacks when implemented correctly.
