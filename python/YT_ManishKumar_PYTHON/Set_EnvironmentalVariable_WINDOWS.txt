# Set Environmental Variables
# For Windows:

# Using CMD:
Method 1: PERMANENT
    > Commands:
        setx DB_USER "root"
        setx DB_PASS "12345678"

    > You will see:
        SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.

    > 1. Close CMD
      2. Close VS Code
      3. Reopen VS Code -> Open NEW terminal

      Then test:
      echo %DB_USER%
      echo %DB_PASS%

Method 2: TEMPORARY
    > Commands:
        set DB_USER=root
        set DB_PASS=12345678

    > You will see:
        SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.

      Then test:
      echo %DB_USER%
      echo %DB_PASS%    
      
    > if you close CMD -> these values are gone


# Using PowerShell:
    > Command:
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("KEY", "VALUE", "SCOPE")

        **The SCOPE parameter must be one of the following: ["User", "Machine", "Process"].

METHOD 1: PERMANENT (User-Level – Recommended)
    > This saves the variable for your Windows user only (most common & safest).

    > Commands:
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DB_USER", "root", "User")
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DB_PASS", "Strong@123", "User")

    > Close PowerShell & Reopen
        Now test:
        echo $env:DB_USER
        echo $env:DB_PASS
        
        Output:
        root
        Strong@123
        
        **Now Python, VS Code, CMD, Spark—everything can read it.

METHOD 2: PERMANENT (System-Level – For All Users)
    > Requires Run as Administrator

    > Open PowerShell as ADMIN
        Right-click → Run as Administrator

    > Commands:
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DB_USER", "root", "Machine")
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DB_PASS", "Strong@123", "Machine")

    >Restart VS Code / CMD
        Then test:
        echo $env:DB_USER
        echo $env:DB_PASS


METHOD 3: TEMPORARY METHOD (Only for Current Session)
    > Will be LOST after closing PowerShell:

    > Commands:
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DB_USER", "root", "Process")
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DB_PASS", "Strong@123", "Process")

    >Restart VS Code / CMD
        Then test:
        $env:DB_USER = "root"
        $env:DB_PASS = "Strong@123"


# Delete Environment Variables Safely

# Using PowerShell:
    > Commands:
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DB_USER", $null, "User")
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DB_USER", $null, "Machine")

    > Then Restart PowerShell terminal.

# Using CMD:
    > CMD doesn't have direct Delete, but you can overwrite with empty:

    > Commands:
        setx DB_USER ""
        setx DB_PASS ""

    > Then close CMD and Open new CMD
        Test:
        echo %DB_USER%
        echo %DB_PASS%

        **If it prints blank -> Deleted
