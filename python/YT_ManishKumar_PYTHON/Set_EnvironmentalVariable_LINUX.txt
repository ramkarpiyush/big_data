# List, Set and Manage Linux Environment Variables

# A few key points to keep in mind when working with Linux environment variables are:
1. Environment variables follow <NAME>=<VALUE> formatting.
2. You can specify multiple values for a single variable by separating them with colons like this: <NAME>=<VALUE1>:<VALUE2>:<VALUE3>
3. Environment variables are case-sensitive.
4. By convention, but not rule, environment variable names are always capitalized.
5. Shell variables are not the same as environment variables. Shell variables only apply to the current shell, not any child processes. 

# LIST a Linux environment variables:
1. printenv 
    > The <printenv> command displays the current environment variables.

    > To display individual environment variables. 
        syntax: printenv <env_variable_name>
    
2. env
    > The <env> command can list all environment variables with output similar to <printenv>
    > 

3. echo $<variable_name>
    > To display a single Linux environment variable

    **The echo $<variable_name> command also works for shell variables that are NOT environment variables. 

4. declare 
    > This built-in shell utility can display shell and environment variables using this command.

5. set 
    > Displays shell variables, environment variables, and shell functions.    

6. compgen -v 
    > Displays the names of all your shell and environment variables (without their values).


# SET a Linux Environmental Variables:
    > syntax: export <NAME>='<value>'

# Create a Shell Variables:
    > syntax: <NAME>='<value>'

** Think of shell variables as LOCAL variables in a function, and environment variables as GLOBAL variables that child processes can see.

# Convert a Shell Variable to an Environment Variable:
    syntax: export <Shell_Variable_Name>


# How to Delete Linux Environment Variables
    syntax: unset <env_variable_name>

# How to Make Linux Environment Variables Permanent
    > The environment variables we’ve created so far will only last for the duration of your shell session. 
    > If you log out or reboot, you would need to recreate them if you want to use them.

    METHOD 1: Use .profile
        - The .profiile file exists in a user’s home directory. 
        - You can add environment variables for a user by editing their .profile file to include export commands to set environment variables.
        - Steps:
            1. Change the directory to the user’s home directory cd ~
            2. Open .profile file in a text editor (e.g. nano, vi, vim, etc.)
            3. Add the following line to the bottom of the file: export <ENV_VAL_NAME>='<value>'
            4. Save the changes

        - The changes will take effect on the next login. 
            You can make them take effect for the current terminal using this command:
            syntax: <. ~/.profile>

    METHOD 2: Use .bashrc
        - For non-login shells, you can follow the same process as login shells, but instead of editing ~/.profile file, edit ~/.bashrc.

    METHOD 3: Use /etc/environment
        - Use /etc/environment to Make Environment Variables Permanent System-wide
        - To set system-wide Linux environment variables, you can edit the /etc/environment file. Instead of appending export commands to the file, append the <NAME>='<VALUE>' pair to the end of the file.
        - Steps:
            1. Change directory to the user’s home directory cd /etc
            2. Open environment file in a text editor (e.g. nano, vi, vim, etc.)
            3. Add the following line to the bottom of the file <ENV_VAL_NAME>='<value>'
            4. Save the changes
