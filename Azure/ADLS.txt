# What is the difference between the Standard Azure Blob Storage and the Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2):
1. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) is built on top of Azure Blob Storage.
2. Data Lake Storage comes with a hierarchical namespace (HNS).
    - Blob Storage without HNS has only a flat namespace
3. HNS helps with folder structures and fine grained access control to the data files.
    - Standard Blob Storage traditionally uses only Azure RBAC + SAS, and cannot apply POSIX ACLs.
4. ADLS Gen2 is designed specifically for analytics workload
