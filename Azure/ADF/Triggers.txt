# Triggers - You can execute your pipeline
- Triggers determines when a pipeline execution needs to be kicked off.

- Pipeline and Triggers have a many-to-many relationship (except for the tumbling windows trigger).
- Multiple trigers can kick-off a single pipeline, or a single triger can kick-off Multiple pipelines.

# Types of Triggers:
1. Scheduled triger:
    - A trigger that invoke a pipeline on a wall-clock Schedule.
    - Does NOT keep state — it only runs from now → future.
    - Scheduled trigger runs only from present to future

2. Tumbling window trigger: (Fixed Windows With No Overlap)
    - A trigger that operates on a periodic interval, while also retaining state.
    - Keeps state and ensures each time window is processed exactly once.
    - To handle the historical data we can use this trigger. 
    - It works with future and past windows also.
    e.g. Suppose you have hourly sales data arriving into a data lake:
        Window 1 → 00:00–01:00
        Window 2 → 01:00–02:00
        Window 3 → 02:00–03:00
        If one window fails, only that window is re‑run—preserving correctness.

3. Event-based trigger:
    - A trigger that responds to an Event.
    - Types:
        1. Storage
        2. Custom
