# Integration Runtime (IR):
- IR = The engine (compute) that Azure Data Factory uses to actually perform tasks.
- ADF itself is only the orchestrator
- The IR is the actual worker that does the real work such as:
    - Moving data
    - Transforming data
    - Connecting to data sources
    - Executing compute tasks
- ADF can’t directly access data or run transformations on its own—it always uses an IR.
- IR = ADF’s execution engine (compute + connectivity + logic)
    - Think of it as a combination of:
        - Compute (VMs, nodes, memory, CPU)
        - Networking (to reach your sources)
        - Optional clustering (for scaling/parallelism)
- ADF only triggers pipelines -> IR actually executes them.

# Types of Integration Runtimes (IR):
1. Azure Integration Runtime
2. Self-Hosted Integration Runtime
3. Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime

1. Azure Integration Runtime:
- Azure Integration Runtime is a Microsoft‑managed, serverless compute environment that can scale into a cluster for Data Flows.
- ADF uses scalable Azure infrastructure to:
    - Copy/move data between cloud sources
    - Execute data flows
    - Connect to SaaS services

- Azure IR has two execution modes depending on the task:    
    1. Azure IR as Simple Compute:
        - Used when running Copy activities or Lookup, Get Metadata, web calls, etc.
    
    2. Azure IR as a Cluster (Cluster mode):
        - Azure IR automatically becomes a Spark cluster ONLY when you run:
            - Mapping Data Flows
            - Wrangling Data Flows
            - (Synapse) Data Flow activities
- Note:  
    Azure IR = Compute for data movement
    Azure IR = Cluster for data transformations (Data Flows)

2. Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR):
- A runtime you install on your on-premise server or VM.
- Used when Azure cannot directly reach your data source.
- Why it exists?
    For on-prem → cloud or private network → cloud movement.
- Enterprise Use Case:
    Connecting On‑Prem Data Warehouse or ERP
    Example: A bank wants to extract customer data from On‑Prem Oracle DB (behind firewall) → Azure Data Lake.
    - Because the Oracle server is inside the corporate network, ADF can’t access it.
    - So we install SHIR inside the network. SHIR acts like a:
        - Secure bridge/tunnel
        - Executes copy commands
        - Pushes data to Azure

3. Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime:
- A cluster of servers running SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages as-is in Azure.
- This is for organizations migrating old SSIS ETL pipelines without rewriting.
- Enterprise Use Case: Lift & shift of existing ETL
    - A healthcare company has 500 SSIS packages doing:
        - Patient data loading
        - Claims transformations
        - File-based ingestion

    - They want to move to cloud but keep SSIS.
    - Azure-SSIS IR allows running the packages in ADF without rewriting into Data Flows.
