1. Pipeline: The Delivery Route
    - A pipeline is like a plan or route that tells ADF what steps to follow.

2. Activity: Tasks in the Route
    - Each pipeline contains activities, which are the individual tasks.
    - types:
        1. Data movement 
        2. Data transformation
        3. Control flow

3. Datasets: 
    - A dataset tells ADF where the data lives and in what format.
    - Datasets are simply points or references the data, which you want to use in your activities as input or Output.

4. Linked services: Connection Info
    - A linked service is like a connection string ADF uses to log into systems.
    - 

5. Triggers: Start Timers
    - Triggers decide when a pipeline should run.

6. Integration Runtime (IR): The Delivery Vehicle
    - The IR is the engine that actually performs the work (copying, transforming, moving data).
    - Three types:
        1. Azure IR – Microsoft-managed (fully cloud)
        2. Self-hosted IR – your own machine or VM
        3. SSIS IR – to run old SSIS packages

7. Data Flows: Data Cleaning Factory
    - Data flows allow you to transform data visually (no code).

8. Control Flow: Logic / Decision Making
    - Control flow helps pipelines make decisions.
    - Examples:
        - If a file exists → run step
        - For each file → repeat
        - Wait until a condition is met
